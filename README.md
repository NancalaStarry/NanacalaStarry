I’m From China, where I made friends with a powerful and glorious dragon! _(This is real, not a human. I swear.)_
And now we still have a good time with each other. *owo*

I have played Minecraft for over ten years, so yeah, I definitely love this game pretty much.
I enjoy providing Minecraft mods with Chinese translations for free.📜
And Don't worry, I'll do it wholeheartedly. Translation is a wonderful thing!❤️

And I help lots of people to solve the crash hidden deep under Minecraft.
Of course it won't be charged, helping others is also a wonderful thing~

Friendship is magic is the best animation!

Currently I have a wish to develop a game🕹️. Hopefully I can make it.
