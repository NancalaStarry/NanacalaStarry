## Mae govannen👋

I’m from China, where I made friends with a powerful and glorious **dragon**! _(This is real, **not a lizard or human or something else**. I swear.)_  
And now we still have a good time with each other. *owo*

I have played Minecraft for over ten years, so yeah, definitely love this game pretty much.  

I enjoy providing Minecraft mods with Chinese translations for free.📜  
And Don't worry, I'll do it wholeheartedly. Translation is a wonderful thing!❤️

And I help lots of people to solve the crash hidden deep under Minecraft.   
I also posted quite a few crash solution articles on Bilibili.  
Of course it won't be charged, helping others is also a wonderful thing~ :3

_Friendship is magic_ is the best animation!  

Currently I have a wish to develop a game🕹️. Hopefully I can make it.
